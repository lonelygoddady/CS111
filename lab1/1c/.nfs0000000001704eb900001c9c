Curriculum Vitae
Tips and Samples

THE BASICS
The curriculum vitae, also known as a CV or vita, is a comprehensive statement of your educational background, teaching, and research experience. It is the standard representation of credentials within academia.
The full CV is only used when applying for academic positions in four-year institutions.
Do not use a CV when applying to community colleges—use a teacher-focused résumé instead.
Tailor your CV to the specific positions to which you are applying and place more relevant sections earlier in the document.
For a position at a teaching-focused liberal arts college, the CV will strongly emphasize teaching.
For a position at a research-intensive university, the CV will accentuate research.
Format can vary by field, so also seek disciplinary-specific advice from advisers, professors, and others within your field.
There are no length restrictions for CVs.

FORMATTING
Your CV must be well organized and easy to read.
Choose an effective format and be consistent.
Use bolds, italics, underlines, and capitalization to draw attention.
List all relevant items in reverse chronological order in each section.
Strategically place the most important information near the top and/or left side of the page.
In general, place the name of the position, title, award, or institution on the left
side of the page and associated dates on the right.
Use a footer with page numbers and your last name, in case pages get separated.

DESCRIBE YOUR EXPERIENCES
Articulate what you have done and take advantage of the opportunity to describe your research and teaching experiences—do more than simply list them.
Avoid the bland phrase “responsibilities included.” This can sound like a dull job description. Instead, use bullets to describe your activities, accomplishments, and successes.
